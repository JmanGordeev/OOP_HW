 RAR is a console application allowing to manage archive files
  in command line mode. RAR provides compression, encryption,
  data recovery and many other functions described in this manual.

    RAR supports only RAR format archives, which have .rar file name
  extension by default. ZIP and other formats are not supported.
  Even if you specify .zip extension when creating an archive, it will
  still be in RAR format. Windows users may install WinRAR, which supports
  more archive types including RAR and ZIP formats.

    WinRAR provides both graphical user interface and command line mode.
  While console RAR and GUI WinRAR have the similar command line syntax,
  some differences exist. So it is recommended to use this rar.txt manual
  for console RAR (rar.exe in case of Windows version) and winrar.chm
  WinRAR help file for GUI WinRAR (winrar.exe).
