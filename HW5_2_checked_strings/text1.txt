RAR and UnRAR for Unix read configuration information from .rarrc file
  in a user's home directory (stored in HOME environment variable)
  or in /etc directory.

  WinRAR and UnRAR for Windows read configuration information from rar.ini file,
  placed in the same directory as the rar.exe file.
   RAR supports only RAR format archives, which have .rar file name
    extension by default. ZIP and other formats are not supported.
    Even if you specify .zip extension when creating an archive, it will
    still be in RAR format. Windows users may install WinRAR, which supports
    more archive types including RAR and ZIP formats.
